This vignette will show you how to convert networks between graphNEL and Cytoscape.

### Installation
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("RCy3")

### Required Software
The whole point of RCy3 is to connect with Cytoscape. You will need to install and launch Cytoscape: 

* Download the latest Cytoscape from http://www.cytoscape.org/download.php
* Complete installation wizard
* Launch Cytoscape 

### From graphNEL to Cytoscape
The graph package is a popular network tool among R users. With RCy3, you can easily translate graphNEL networks to Cytoscape networks!

Create a simple GraphNEL object
```{r}
g <- makeSimpleGraph()
```

Now pass it along to Cytoscape:

```{r}
createNetworkFromGraph(g,"myGraph")
```
### From Cytoscape to GraphNEL 
Inversely, you can use createGraphFromNetwork() in RCy3 to retreive vertex (node) and edge data.frames to construct a GraphNEL object. 

```{r}
g2 <- createGraphFromNetwork("myGraph")
```

Compare the round-trip result for yourself...
```{r}
g;g2
```
